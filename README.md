## Install

  1. You need to install nodejs, mongo and git before run LooWID.
  2. Download source code.`
      git clone https://github.com/loowid/loowid /install/dir
`
  3. Create and download public and private keys of your self-signed certificate.

      ```
      http://www.cert-depot.com/
      If no certificate available LooWID startup in http port.
      When https port is running, http port is used only to redirect to https port.
      ```

  4. `npm install --production`
  5. `npm start`
  6. Connect to https://localhost/

**Note**: If you want to work with the **latest stable release** then you must clone `https://github.com/loowid/loowid/releases/latest`

## Docker

  Too many steps to install? Don't worry LooWID is also dockerized !! If you have docker and docker-compose installed you can just type:

    docker-compose up

  This will bring up a copy of MongoDB and LooWID in 2 containers and you can access LooWID on https://{docker-ip/}

## Development

  Follow the same steps but change steps 5 and following:

  5. `npm install -g grunt-cli`

  6. `npm install`

  7. `grunt` (Default development server)

	 * `grunt cluster`	: Run cluster server with 2 nodes (--nodes=N change default value)
	 * `grunt prod`		: Run production environment do not watch for code changes
	 * `grunt test`		: Run unit tests

	 ```
	 Use --port=80 --sport=443 --bport=8000 to change default port values.
	 add --mongodb=off to don't startup mongodb and provide it independently
	 ```
	 ```
	 grunt cluster --sport=9090 --port=8080 --bport=7000 --nodes=3
	 listen in ports 8080, 7001, 7002, 7003 (http) and 9090 (https).
	 ```
	 ```
	 grunt --port=8080
	 will listen in ports 443 (https) and 8080 (http).
	 ```
	 ```
	 grunt --mongodb=off
	 won't startup mongodb
	 ```
	 ```
	 grunt test --testcase=<file_name> --nodes=3
	 run only <file_name> testcase in a cluster environment with 3 nodes. See spec/tests folder.
	 ```

  7. If you get some npm packages errors try `npm update` (We had that errors on Windows 7 64bits)

## Configuration


  There are some environment variables you may set to configure your LooWID deployment.
  Check your hosting provider documentation in order to know how to set this values, for example, with openshift you can type:
  ```
  	rhc env set VARIABLE=VALUE -a app
  ```
  1. Credentials to access to some admin resources (debug level and stats). By default admin/admin.

  ```
  ADMIN_USERNAME=<your-admin-username>
  ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your-admin-password>
  ```
  2. Chrome plugin extension id. Set the id of your own plugin extension for screen sharing. A generic domain plugin will be used by default.

  ```
  CEXTID=<generic-domain-plugin-id>
  ```
  3. COTURN configuration, to enable [STUN/TURN service](https://github.com/loowid/loowid/wiki/LooWID's-communication-stack) on


  ```
Mandatory:
  COTURN_SERVER=<ip or hostname of your coturn server>:<port>
  COTURN_AUTH_USERNAME=<coturn generated username>
  COTURN_AUTH_SECRET=<coturn secret>

Optional:

  COTURN_AUTH_HOURS=<number of hours that the credentials will be valid>
  COTURN_EXCLUSIVE=<set any value to make you coturn server the only server in the ice list>
  ```
  4. Room timeout. The number of days that a room can be active on the server before expires (15 days by default).

  ```
  ROOM_TIMEOUT=15
  ```
  5. Path to certificate files. By default `public.pem` and `private.pem` in the same folder, you could set the full path to your own certificate files.

  ```
  PUBLIC_KEY=<path-to-your-cert-public.pem>
  PRIVATE_KEY=<path-to-your-privatekey.pem>
  ```

  6. LTI Producer Configuration. The consumer connects with multiple LooWID rooms depends on LTI context, the first user with OWNER_ROLE will be the room owner.
  The LooWID producer entrypoint is configured with LTI_PATH (/lti). Set LTI_DOMAIN if your host is behind a proxy with other domain than req.headers.host. [More about LTI](https://github.com/loowid/loowid/wiki/Setting-up-IMS-LTI-connection)

  ```
  LTI_KEY=<lti-key>
  LTI_SECRET=<lti-secret>
  LTI_PATH=<lti-url>
  LTI_DOMAIN=<lti-host>
  LTI_OWNER_ROLES=<lti-owner-role1>,<lti-owner-role2>,...
  ```

  7. Control host and port for websocket connection.

  ```
  WS_HOST=<websocket-host-server>
  WS_PORT=<websocket-port-server>
  ```

  8. MongoDB URL: By Default LooWID uses localhost to connect with mongodb, set one of this variables to connect to another URL.

  ```
  MONGOLAB_URI=<MongoDB URI>
  MONGOHQ_URL=<MongoDB URL>
  ```

  9. Embed.ly configuration, to enable OEMBED service with [Embed.ly](http://embed.ly/)

  ```
  EMBEDLY_APIKEY=<embedly api key>
  ```
